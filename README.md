⚙️ How It Works

    Catalog Filtering
    scripts.js dynamically updates visible products based on category, price, or other selected filters.

    Navigation
    Each page is standalone HTML, linked via nav menus and <a> tags for simple SPA-style browsing.

    Styling
    styles.css uses backdrop filters, blur effects, and gradients to create a modern glassmorphic UI.
